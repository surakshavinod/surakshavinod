# Hi there! üëã

I'm Suraksha Vinod, a Masters student in Bioinformatics at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta. I'm passionate about applying computational approaches to answer biological questions, which is why I am pursuing a degree in Bioinformatics. My research interests are varied and include precision medicine and predictive health (personalized medicine), cancer biology, ML in biology, human genomics, functional genomics and disease omics. I'm also interested in neurodegenerative disorders because of a familial connection.
